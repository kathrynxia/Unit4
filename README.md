Hi! 

This is a computer science project I did. Having previously only used arrays and ArrayLists, this exercise helped me understand nodes and linked lists better. It's nothing groundbreaking at all, but it is a pretty apt representation of how I tackle problems. Whenever I don't understand something, coding is the best (and most fun) way to learn it.
